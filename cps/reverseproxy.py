    """Wrap the application in this middleware and configure the
    front-end server to add these headers, to let you quietly bind
    this to a URL other than / and to an HTTP scheme that is
    different from what is used locally.

    Code courtesy of: https://flask.pocoo.org/snippets/35/

    In nginx:
    location /myprefix {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8083;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Scheme $scheme;
        proxy_set_header X-Script-Name /myprefix;
        }

    If you cannot configure these headers (for instance, if you are serving calibre-web from
    behind an opaque TLS terminator or unconfigurable reverse proxy such as tailscale funnel), 
    then you may also use optional environment variables to achieve the same result. 

    To configure a prefix override (script name), set PROXY_SCRIPT_NAME
    To configure a scheme override, set PROXY_SCHEME
    To configure a host override, set PROXY_HOST
    To configure a port override, set PROXY_PORT
