### **General**

**Communication language** is english. Google translated texts are not as bad as you might think, they are usually understandable, so don't worry if you generate your post that way.

**Calibre-Web** is not **Calibre**. If you are having a question regarding Calibre please post this at their [repository](https://github.com/kovidgoyal/calibre).

**Docker-Containers** of Calibre-Web are maintained by different persons than the people who drive Calibre-Web. If we come to the conclusion during our analysis that the problem is related to Docker, we might ask you to open a new issue at the reprository of the Docker Container.

If you are having **Basic Installation Problems** with python or it's dependencies, please consider using your favorite search engine to find a solution. In case you can't find a solution, we are happy to help you.

We can offer only very limited support regarding configuration of **Reverse-Proxy Installations**, **OPDS-Reader** or other programs in combination with Calibre-Web. 

### **Translation**

Some of the user languages in Calibre-Web having missing translations. We are happy to add the missing texts if you translate them. Create a Pull Request, create an issue with the .po file attached, or write an email to "ozzie.fernandez.isaacs@googlemail.com" with attached translation file. To display all book languages in your native language an additional file is used (iso_language_names.py). The content of this file is autogenerated with the corresponding translations of Calibre, please do not edit this file on your own. 

### **Documentation**

The Calibre-Web documentation is hosted in the Github [Wiki](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki). The Wiki is open to everybody, if you find a problem, feel free to correct it. If information is missing, you are welcome to add it. The content will be reviewed time by time. Please try to be consitent with the form with the other Wiki pages (e.g. the project name is Calibre-Web with 2 capital letters and a dash in between).

### **Reporting a bug**

Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a **security vulnerability** in Calibre-Web. Please write intead an email to "ozzie.fernandez.isaacs@googlemail.com".

Ensure the ***bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues). Please also check if a solution for your problem can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki).

If you're unable to find an **open issue** addressing the problem, open a [new one](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Be sure to include a **title** and **clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, the **issue form** helps you providing the right information. Deleting the form and just pasting the stack trace doesn't speed up fixing the problem. If your issue could be resolved, consider closing the issue. 

### **Feature Request**

If there is a feature missing in Calibre-Web and you can't find a feature request in the [Issues](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues) section, you could create a [feature request](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=feature_request.md&title=). 
We will not extend Calibre-Web with any more login abilitys or add further files storages, or file syncing ability. Furthermore Calibre-Web is made for home usage for company inhouse usage, so requests regarding any sorts of social interaction capability, payment routines, search engine or web site analytics integration will not be implemeted. 

### **Contributing code to Calibre-Web**

Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch. Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

In case your code enhances features of Calibre-Web: Create your pull request for the development branch if your enhancement consits of more than some lines of code in a local section of Calibre-Webs code. This makes it easier to test it and check all implication before it's made public. 

Please check if your code runs on Python 2.7 (still necessary in 2020) and mainly on python 3. If possible and the feature is related to operating system functions, try to check it on Windows and Linux. 
Calibre-Web is automatically tested on Linux in combination with python 3.7. The code for testing is in a [seperate repo](https://github.com/OzzieIsaacs/calibre-web-test) on Github. It uses unittest and performs real system tests with selenium, would be great if you could consider also writing some tests. 
A static code analysis is done by Codacy, but it's partly broken and doesn't run automatically. You could check your code with ESLint before contributing, a configuration file can be found in the projects root folder.
