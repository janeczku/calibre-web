# 2024-01-11: HOW THIS WORKS...
# 0) xklb sends a flood of yt-dlp status message lines like "downloading  59.8%    2.29MiB/s" to STDERR.
# 1) Then, "2> >(...)" reroutes (only those raw lines!) to STDIN, instead of logging them (as "Debug" lines).
# 2) Then, upon receiving them at STDIN, "> >(...)" again prevents (only those raw lines!) from being logged (as "Info" messages).
# 3) Then, cps/tasks/download.py uses an equivalent Python REGEX to flag (only these raw lines! yes a 3rd time!)
#    parsing them to send "percentage download progress" info along to the "Tasks" view in the web front-end:
#    https://github.com/iiab/calibre-web/blob/870bf6d35f890712f44ce711f3f8f6b541ccf1fe/cps/tasks/download.py#L46
