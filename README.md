## Installation

### Installation via pip (recommended)

1. **Create a virtual environment**: It’s essential to isolate your Calibre-Web installation to avoid dependency conflicts. You can create a virtual environment by running:
   ```
   python3 -m venv calibre-web-env
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```
   source calibre-web-env/bin/activate
   ```
3. **Install Calibre-Web**: Use pip to install the application:
   ```
   pip install calibreweb
   ```
4. **Install optional features**: For additional functionality, you may need to install optional features. Refer to [this page](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Dependencies-in-Calibre-Web-Linux-and-Windows) for details on what can be installed.
5. **Start Calibre-Web**: After installation, you can start the application with:
   ```
   cps
   ```

*Note: Users of Raspberry Pi OS may encounter installation issues. If you do, try upgrading pip and/or installing cargo as follows:*
   ```
   ./venv/bin/python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
   sudo apt install cargo
   ```

### Important Links
- For additional installation examples, check the following:
   - [Manual installation](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Manual-installation)
   - [Linux Mint installation](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/How-To:-Install-Calibre-Web-in-Linux-Mint-19-or-20)
   - [Cloud Provider setup](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/How-To:-Install-Calibre-Web-on-a-Cloud-Provider)

## Quick Start

1. **Access Calibre-Web**: Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8083
   ```
   or for the OPDS catalog:
   ```
   http://localhost:8083/opds
   ```
2. **Log in**: Use the default admin credentials:
   - **Username:** admin
   - **Password:** admin123
3. **Database Setup**: If you do not have a Calibre database, download a sample from:
   ```
   https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/raw/master/library/metadata.db
   ```
   Move it out of the Calibre-Web folder to avoid overwriting during updates.
4. **Configure Calibre Database**: In the admin interface, set the `Location of Calibre database` to the path of the folder containing your Calibre library (where `metadata.db` is located) and click "Save".
5. **Google Drive Integration**: For hosting your Calibre library on Google Drive, refer to the [Google Drive integration guide](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/G-Drive-Setup#using-google-drive-integration).
6. **Admin Configuration**: Configure your instance via the admin page, referring to the [Basic Configuration](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#basic-configuration) and [UI Configuration](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/Configuration#ui-configuration) guides.

## Requirements

- **Python Version**: Ensure you have Python 3.7 or newer.
- **Imagemagick**: Required for cover extraction from EPUBs. Windows users may also need to install [Ghostscript](https://ghostscript.com/releases/gsdnld.html) for PDF cover extraction.
- **Optional Tools**:
   - **Calibre desktop program**: Recommended for on-the-fly conversion and metadata editing. Set the path to Calibre’s converter tool on the setup page.
   - **Kepubify tool**: Needed for Kobo device support. Download the tool and place the binary in `/opt/kepubify` on Linux or `C:\Program Files\kepubify` on Windows.

## Docker Images

Pre-built Docker images are available:

### **LinuxServer - x64, aarch64**
- **Docker Hub**: [linuxserver/calibre-web](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/calibre-web)
- **GitHub**: [linuxserver/docker-calibre-web](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-calibre-web)
- **Optional Calibre layer**: [linuxserver/docker-mods](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-mods/tree/universal-calibre)

To include the Calibre `ebook-convert` binary (x64 only), add the environment variable:
``` 
DOCKER_MODS=linuxserver/mods:universal-calibre
```
in your Docker run/compose file. Omit this variable for a lightweight image.

- **Paths Configuration**:
   - Set **Path to Calibre Binaries** to `/usr/bin`.
   - Set **Path to Unrar** to `/usr/bin/unrar`.

## Reverse Proxy
If you want to self-host calibre-web securely on a remote host, you must not
let it listen to 0.0.0.0 and you must use TLS/SSL.

The best way to do this is via either an Nginx (best) or Apache reverse-proxy
in conjunction with [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/getting-started/).

The virtual host configurations for both Nginx and Apache can be located in
the `web` directory. There is also a gist of the [calibre-web nginx
config](https://gist.github.com/hopeseekr/292f345b01d598a1fd0dfcf70e8f5fcc).

To set `calibre-web` to listen to localhost, start the command with `-i 127.0.0.4`

To do this via the systemd service:

* Edit `/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/calibre-web.service`
* Change to `ExecStart=/usr/lib/calibre-web/cps.py -i 127.0.0.4`
* `sudo systemctl daemon-reload; sudo systemctl restart calibre-web`

## Troubleshooting

- **Common Issues**: 
   - If you experience issues starting the application, check the log files located in the `logs` directory for error messages.
   - If eBooks fail to load, verify that the `Location of Calibre database` is correctly set and that the database file is accessible.

- **Configuration Errors**: Ensure that your Calibre database is compatible and properly formatted. Refer to the Calibre documentation for guidance on maintaining the database.

- **Performance Problems**: 
   - If the application is slow, consider increasing the allocated resources (CPU/RAM) to your server or optimizing the Calibre database by removing duplicates and unnecessary entries.
   - Regularly clear the cache in your web browser to improve loading times.

- **User Management Issues**: If users are unable to log in or register, check the user permission settings in the admin interface. Ensure that registration is enabled and that users are being assigned appropriate roles.

- **Support Resources**: For additional help, consider visiting the [FAQ section](https://github.com/janeczku/calibre-web/wiki/FAQ) of the wiki or posting your questions in the [Discord community](https://discord.gg/h2VsJ2NEfB).
